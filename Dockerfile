# Use Node.js 16 as the base image
FROM node:16

# Set the working directory for the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy backend package.json and install backend dependencies
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy frontend package.json and install frontend dependencies
COPY frontend/package.json ./frontend/
RUN cd frontend && npm install

# Copy the rest of the application files
COPY . .

# Build the frontend
RUN cd frontend && npm run build

# Expose port 3000 for the backend server
EXPOSE 3000

# Set the start command for the backend server
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Review of the Implementation

1. **Base Image**: The Dockerfile uses `node:16` as the base image, fulfilling the requirement.
2. **Working Directory**: The working directory is set to `/app`, which is a common convention for Node.js applications.
3. **Copy `package.json` Files**: Both the backend and frontend `package.json` files are copied into the container.
4. **Install Dependencies**: Dependencies for both the backend and frontend are installed using `npm install`.
5. **Copy Application Files**: All application files are copied into the container.
6. **Build Frontend**: The frontend is built using `npm run build` inside the `frontend` directory.
7. **Expose Port**: Port 3000 is exposed for the backend server.
8. **Start Command**: The backend server is started using `npm start`.

### Final Output

The complete Dockerfile is provided below:
